# Unexpected Return Behavior in Nested MATLAB Functions

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in MATLAB related to nested functions and early returns. The issue arises when an inner function has an early return that doesn't properly handle all conditions, leading to unexpected results or errors.

## Bug Description
The `myFunction` calls the nested function `someCalculation`.  `someCalculation` contains an early return statement (`return;`) which is not always executed as expected. This leads to potential errors if the other branches of `someCalculation` are not well handled. 

## Solution
The provided solution modifies the `someCalculation` function to ensure that an output is always assigned before the function ends, even if an early return was intended to be triggered under specific conditions. This prevents undefined behavior.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `bug.m` file in MATLAB.
3. Run `myFunction` with different input values, including 0 and 5.  Observe the unexpected behavior.
4. Open the `bugSolution.m` file in MATLAB. 
5. Run the corrected `myFunction` with the same inputs. Observe the correct behavior.
